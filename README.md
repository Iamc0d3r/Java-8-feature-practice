# Java 8 Features

## Lambda Expressions
Lambda expressions allow implementing functional interfaces in a compact way.

## Functional Programming 
Java 8 added support for functional-style programming with features like lambda expressions and default methods.

## Default Methods
Default methods allow adding new functionality to interfaces without breaking existing implementations.

## Predicates, Functions
Java 8 introduced functional interfaces like Predicate and Function to support lambda expressions. 

## Double Colon Operator (::)
The double colon operator (::) is used to reference methods by name.

## Stream API
The Stream API allows functional-style operations on streams of elements like maps, filters, matching, reductions, etc.

## Date and Time API
The new Date/Time API in Java 8 is based on the Joda Time library and supports modern date and time handling.
